# Fields with one entry per regression

name: map_reg

descr: |
  This table combines info from map_cells, match_reg and match_regstat to
  store best maps in a data base used for meta studies.

  This means only if our map_cell determines that a particular cell in an article
  table is mapped to a specific regression, we will have the corresponding entry
  here in map_reg.

index:
  main_index: [artid, mapid, variant, runid,  regid]

fields:
  artid:
    descr: ID of the article that is analyzed.

  mapid:
    type: int
    descr: In principal, we might consider multiple maps.

  variant:
    descr: Variant of the supplement regression that is matched

  step:
    descr: ID of reg in supplement using DAP

  runid:
    descr: Alternative reg id
    type: int

  tabid:

  panel_num:
    type: int

  regcol:
    type: int

  regid:
    descr: ID of reg in article

  cmd:

  lang:

  paren_type:
    descr: What is most likely shown in the parentheses se, p or t

  match_score:
    descr: |
      Number between 0 and 1 describing the overall match quality.
      This number only uses information from the number of matched coefficients,
      standard errors (or t / p) and matched statistics.
      It is subjectively decided how much close matches (one deci distance away)
      count.
    type: num

  coef_match_score:
    type: num

  stat_match_score:
    type: num

  tabid_ref_match:
    descr: |
      Do the tabid references from the code comment match the tabid
      from the article?
      +1 they match
      -1 don't match
      0 at least one tabid is not well specified
    type: int

  art_ncoef:
    type: int

  code_ncoef:
    type: int

  art_nstat:
    type: int

  code_nfoundstat:
    descr: |
      Just the number of presented stats from the article that
      we could match by name, even if the values are wrong.
      Only stats that could be matched by name enter the match_core
    type: int


  is_small_reg:
    type: bool
    descr: |
      A small regression in an article table corresponds to the case that mutliple
      rows in a table column correspond to different regressions instead of coefficients
      for different explanatory variables.

      We can create this column by checking whether regid is in art_small_reg or not.

  coef_pos:
    type: int
    descr: |
      Only relevant for small regressions the row of the shown coefficients.

# Fields with one entry per regression

name: map_reg

descr: |
  Summary statistic of the matching quality between article and code regression
  pairs. Contains matching score for coefficients / standard errors, as
  well as for regression statistics.
  Roughly the matching score is the average of matched numbers, but it is
  slightly adapted, e.g. a little rounding error still gives a positive score.
  Only regression pairs are considered that have at least a matching score of 0.5
  for the coefficients / se.
index:
  main_index: [artid, step, regid]

fields:
  artid:
    descr: ID of the article that is analyzed.

  step:
    descr: ID of reg in supplement

  regid:
    descr: ID of reg in article

  paren_type:
    descr: What is most likely shown in the parentheses

  match_score:
    descr: |
      Number between 0 and 1 describing the overall match quality.
      This number only uses information from the number of matched coefficients,
      standard errors (or t / p) and matched statistics.
      It is subjectively decided how much close matches (one deci distance away)
      count.

  code_nfoundstat:
    descr: |
